# Coalition Technologies Skills Test

## Pros
The webpage I constructed is functional and looks good on a fullscreen desktop.

## Cons
The page is minimally responsive. I used direct assets in place of text blocks which causes them to shrimk beyond readability on a phone screen.
I had a lot of difficulty digging the assets I needed out of the PSD file and attempting to understand the relationship between the layers.

## Lessons Learned
I probably should have reached out to the team at Coalition to clear up some confusion I had about the file format and the page's visual/functional expectations.
